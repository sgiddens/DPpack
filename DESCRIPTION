Description: An implementation of common statistical analysis and models with 
    differential privacy guarantees. The package contains, for example, 
    functions providing differentially private computations of mean, variance, 
    median, histograms, and contingency tables. It also implements some 
    statistical models and machine learning algorithms such as linear regression 
    and SVM. In addition, it implements some popular randomization mechanisms 
    such as the Laplace mechanism, Gaussian mechanism, and exponential 
    mechanism.
