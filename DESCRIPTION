Description: An implementation of various common statistical functions
    and models using differential privacy. The package contains, for
    example, functions providing differentially private computations of
    mean, variance, median, histograms, contingency tables, and other similar
    functions. It also implements some statistical models such as linear 
    regression and SVM. In addition, it implements some popular differential
    privacy mechanisms that are used in the computations.
