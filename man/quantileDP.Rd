\usage{
quantileDP(
  x,
  quant,
  eps,
  which.sensitivity = "bounded",
  lower.bound = NULL,
  upper.bound = NULL,
  mechanism = "exponential",
  delt = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector of which the quantile will be taken.}

\item{quant}{Real number between 0 and 1 indicating which quantile to return.}

\item{eps}{Positive real number defining the epsilon privacy budget.}

\item{which.sensitivity}{String indicating which type of sensitivity to use.
Can be one of {'bounded', 'unbounded', 'both'}. If 'bounded' (default),
returns result plus noise based on bounded definition for differential
privacy. If 'unbounded', returns result plus noise based on unbounded
definition. If 'both', returns result based on both methods
\insertCite{Kifer2011}{DPpack}. Note that if 'both' is chosen, each result
individually satisfies differential privacy at level eps, but may not do so
collectively. Care must be taken not to violate differential privacy in
this case.}

\item{lower.bound}{Real number giving the lower bound of x. If not given, it
is computed from the data to be the min value of x. Note this computation
may result in additional privacy loss.}

\item{upper.bound}{Real number giving the upper bound of x. If not given, it
is computed from the data to be the max value of x. Note this computation
may result in additional privacy loss.}

\item{mechanism}{String indicating which mechanism to use for differential
privacy. Currently the following mechanisms are supported: {'exponential'}.
See \code{\link{exponentialMechanism}} for a description of the supported
mechanisms.}

\item{delt}{Positive real number defining the delta privacy parameter (not
currently used).}
}
\value{
A list of the sanitized quantiles based on the bounded and/or
unbounded definitions of differential privacy.
}
\description{
This function computes the differentially private quantile of an input vector
at user-specified levels of epsilon and delta.
