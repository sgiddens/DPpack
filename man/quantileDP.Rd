\usage{
quantileDP(
  x,
  quant,
  eps,
  lower.bound,
  upper.bound,
  which.sensitivity = "bounded",
  mechanism = "exponential",
  uniform.sampling = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector of which the quantile will be taken.}

\item{quant}{Real number between 0 and 1 indicating which quantile to return.}

\item{eps}{Positive real number defining the epsilon privacy budget.}

\item{lower.bound}{Real number giving the global or public lower bound of x.}

\item{upper.bound}{Real number giving the global or public upper bound of x.}

\item{which.sensitivity}{String indicating which type of sensitivity to use.
Can be one of {'bounded', 'unbounded', 'both'}. If 'bounded' (default),
returns result plus noise based on bounded definition for differential
privacy. If 'unbounded', returns result plus noise based on unbounded
definition. If 'both', returns result based on both methods
\insertCite{Kifer2011}{DPpack}. Note that if 'both' is chosen, each result
individually satisfies differential privacy at level eps, but may not do so
collectively and in composition. Care must be taken not to violate
differential privacy in this case.}

\item{mechanism}{String indicating which mechanism to use for differential
privacy. Currently the following mechanisms are supported: {'exponential'}.
See \code{\link{ExponentialMechanism}} for a description of the supported
mechanisms.}

\item{uniform.sampling}{Boolean indicating whether to sample uniformly
between sorted dataset values when returning the private quantile. If TRUE,
it is possible for this function to return any number in the range
\link{lower.bound, upper.bound}. If FALSE, only a value present in the dataset
or the lower bound can be returned.}
}
\value{
Sanitized quantile(s) based on the bounded and/or unbounded
definitions of differential privacy.
}
\description{
This function computes the differentially private quantile of an input vector
at user-specified privacy levels of epsilon and delta.
}
\examples{
D <- rnorm(500)
lower.bound <- -3 # 3 standard deviations below mean
upper.bound <- 3 # 3 standard deviations above mean

quant <- 0.25
eps <- 1
# Get 25th quantile satisfying pure 1-differential privacy
private.quantile <- quantileDP(D, quant, eps, lower.bound, upper.bound)
private.quantile

# Get 75th quantile requiring released value to be in dataset
quant <- 0.75
private.quantile <- quantileDP(D, quant, eps, lower.bound, upper.bound,
                               uniform.sampling = FALSE)
private.quantile
