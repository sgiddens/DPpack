\usage{
sdDP(
  x,
  eps,
  lower.bounds,
  upper.bounds,
  which.sensitivity = "bounded",
  mechanism = "Laplace",
  delta = 0,
  type.DP = "aDP"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector whose variance is desired.}

\item{eps}{Positive real number defining the epsilon privacy budget.}

\item{which.sensitivity}{String indicating which type of sensitivity to use.
Can be one of {'bounded', 'unbounded', 'both'}. If 'bounded' (default),
returns result based on bounded definition for differential privacy. If
'unbounded', returns result based on unbounded definition. If 'both',
returns result based on both methods \insertCite{Kifer2011}{DPpack}. Note
that if 'both' is chosen, each result individually satisfies (eps,
delta)-differential privacy, but may not do so collectively and in
composition. Care must be taken not to violate differential privacy in this
case.}

\item{mechanism}{String indicating which mechanism to use for differential
privacy. Currently the following mechanisms are supported: {'Laplace',
'Gaussian'}. Default is Laplace. See \code{\link{LaplaceMechanism}} and
\code{\link{GaussianMechanism}} for a description of the supported
mechanisms.}

\item{delta}{Nonnegative real number defining the delta privacy parameter. If
0 (default), reduces to eps-DP and the Laplace mechanism is used.}

\item{type.DP}{String indicating the type of differential privacy desired for
the Gaussian mechanism (if selected). Can be either 'pDP' for probabilistic
DP \insertCite{Machanavajjhala2008}{DPpack} or 'aDP' for approximate DP
\insertCite{Dwork2006b}{DPpack}. Note that if 'aDP' is chosen, epsilon must
be strictly less than 1.}

\item{lower.bound}{Scalar representing the global or public lower bound on
values of x.}

\item{upper.bound}{Scalar representing the global or public upper bound on
values of x.}
}
\value{
Sanitized standard deviation based on the bounded and/or unbounded
definitions of differential privacy.
}
\description{
This function computes the differentially private standard deviation of a
given dataset at user-specified privacy levels of epsilon and delta.

\examples{
D <- rnorm(500, mean=3, sd=2)
lb <- -3 # 3 std devs below mean
ub <- 9 # 3 std devs above mean
sdDP(D, 1, lb, ub)
sdDP(D,.5, lb, ub, which.sensitivity='unbounded', mechanism='Gaussian',
  delta=0.01)
