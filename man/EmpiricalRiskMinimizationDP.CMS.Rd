\title{Privacy-preserving Empirical Risk Minimization for Binary Classification}
\description{
This class implements differentially private empirical risk
minimization using the objective perturbation technique
\insertCite{chaudhuri2011}{DPpack}. It is intended to be a framework for
building more specific models via inheritance. See
\code{\link{LogisticRegressionDP}} for an example of this type of
structure.
}
\details{
A new model object of this class accepts as inputs a hypothesis
function, a loss function, a regularizer, an epsilon value for differential
privacy, a lambda value that scales the regularizer, and a constant c
meeting certain constraints related to the loss function. The model can
then be fit with a dataset X (given as a data.frame), a set of binary
labels y for each row of X, as well as upper and lower bounds on the
possible values for each column of X and for y. In fitting, the model
stores a vector of coefficients coeff which satisfy epsilon-level
differential privacy. These can be released directly, or used in
conjunction with the predict method to predict the label of new datapoints.

Note that in order to guarantee epsilon-level privacy for the empirical
risk minimization model, certain constraints must be satisfied for the
values used to construct the object, as well as for the data used to fit.
Specifically, the provided loss function must be convex and doubly
differentiable w.r.t. y.hat with |loss'(y.hat,y)|<=1 and
|loss''(y.hat,y)|<=c for some constant c and for all possible values of
y.hat and y, where y.hat is the predicted label and y is the true label.
The regularizer must be 1-strongly convex and doubly differentiable.
Additionally, it is assumed that if x represents a single row of the
dataset X, then ||x||<=1 for all x. Note that because of this, a bias term
cannot be included without appropriate scaling/preprocessing of the
dataset. To ensure privacy, the add.bias argument in the $fit and $predict
methods should only be utilized in subclasses within this package, not in
this class.

with respect to the values in coeff and of the same form as h. Should be
given such that the ith row of the output represents the gradient of h
with respect to the ith coefficient.}

\item{\code{loss}}{Loss function of the form loss(y.hat, y), where y.hat and y are
matrices, that returns a matrix of the same shape as y.hat and y of loss
function values for the empirical risk minimization model with predicted
labels y.hat and true labels y.}

value of the regularizer at coeff.}

\item{\code{regularizer.gr}}{Function representing the gradient of the

\item{\code{lambda}}{Nonnegative real number representing the regularization
constant.}

\item{\code{eps}}{Positive real number defining the epsilon privacy budget. If set

\item{\code{kernel}}{String indicating which kernel to use for SVM. Must be one of
{'linear', 'Gaussian'}. If 'linear' (default), linear SVM is used. If
'Gaussian,' uses the sampling function corresponding to the Gaussian
(radial) kernel approximation.}

\item{\code{D}}{Value only used in child class
\code{\link{SupportVectorMachineDP}}. Nonnegative integer
indicating the dimensionality of the transform space approximating the
kernel. Higher values of D provide better kernel approximations at a cost
of computational efficiency.}

\item{\code{sampling}}{Value only used in child class
\code{\link{SupportVectorMachineDP}}. String or sampling function.
If a string, must be 'Gaussian' (default), indicating to use the sampling
function corresponding to the Gaussian (radial) kernel approximation. If
a function, must be of the form sampling(d), where d is the input
dimension, and return a (d+1)-dimensional vector of samples corresponding

\item{\code{phi}}{Value only used in child class
\code{\link{SupportVectorMachineDP}}. Function or NULL (default).
If sampling is given as one of the predefined strings, this input is
unnecessary. If sampling is a function, this should also be a function of
the form phi(x, theta), where x is an individual row of of the original
dataset, and theta is a (d+1)-dimensional vector sampled from the Fourier
transform of the kernel to be approximated, where d is the dimension of
x. The function then returns a numeric scalar corresponding to the
pre-filtered value at the given row with the given sampled vector.}

\subsection{Method \code{fit()}}{
Fit the differentially private emprirical risk minimization
model. The function runs the objective perturbation algorithm
\insertCite{chaudhuri2011}{DPpack} to generate an objective function. A
numerical optimization method is then run to find optimal coefficients
for fitting the model given the training data and hyperparameters. The
built-in \code{\link{optim}} function using the "BFGS" optimization
method is used. If h.gr, loss.gr, and regularizer.gr are all given in the
construction of the object, the gradient of the objective function is
utilized by optim as well. The resulting privacy-preserving coefficients
are stored in coeff.
